## Definition
Strategic approach to the management of active phase of labor aimed at prevention of prolonged labor.

## Procedure
1. Confirm active phase of labor, Perform ARM, assign nurse to monitor labor and serve as companion, and assure patient that labor will not be prolonged.

2. Confirm cervical os dilatation rate to be 1cm/hour (hourly VE for the first 3hours then 2 hourly until delivery )

3. Augment labor if cervical os dilatation rate is  <1cm/hour. If no progress in 4 hour perform c/s.

4. Pain relief with IV/IM pethidine or epidural anesthesia.

5. At 2nd stage of labor, encourage patient to bear down with every urge to push.

6. Active management of third stage of labor 


## Modified AML for developing countries 
1. **Confirm** active phase of labor, Perform ARM, and  monitor labor.

2. **Record findings on partograph** with which the alert and action lines are 2 hours apart.

3. **Repeat VE at 4 hours** then record the descent and cervical os dilatation, **then 2 hourly**  VE until delivery 

4. **Do nothing** when cervical os dilatation is on the alert line or to it left; progress is normal

5. Augmentation with oxytocin when cervical os dilatation crosses the action line after excluding CPD.

6. Active management of third stage of labor
