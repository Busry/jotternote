Classification
Base on: 
1. timing
	1. Elective
	2. Emergency
2. Urgency
	1. Emergent(cat 1): Immediate threat to life of mother/fetus (DDI <30min) i.e fetal distress(FSB PH<7.2), cord prolapse, uterine rupture.
	2. Urgent(cat 2): No immediate threat to life but there is compromise to mother or fetus (DDI 60 +/- 15min) i.e APH, FTP in labour with fetal distress.
	3. Schedule(cat 3): No fetal or maternal compromise but early delivery is required (DDI 1-2wks) i.e IUGR, worsening PE, Admitted cat. 4 with PROM.
	4. Elective(cat 4): Done at a time that suit the Obst, pt, and the theater. i.e 2previous c/s not in labour, fetal macrosomia, breech in primi. 
3. incision
	1. LSCS
	2. classical
	3. J-shaped
	4. inverted T
4. scar
	1. Primary
	2. Repeat
