## Introduction

c/section is the delivery of fetus and other POC through incision made on the abdomen and uterus after the age of viability.

The classification of caesarean section is of critical importance in obstetric practice as it provides a standardized framework for identifying, categorizing, and comparing caesarean deliveries
Accurate classification aids in determining the urgency of delivery, optimizing maternal and fetal outcomes, guiding clinical decision-making, and facilitating audit, research, and quality improvement in maternity care

- Provides a **systematic framework** for categorizing caesarean deliveries.
- Helps determine the **urgency of delivery** and optimize maternal–fetal outcomes.
- Supports **clinical decision-making**, resource allocation, and complication anticipation.
- Enables **audit, benchmarking, and quality improvement** in obstetric care.
- Facilitates **research, policy-making, and global comparisons** of caesarean rates.

## Incidence
**Rate of cs in **
 1. JUTH 33.1%.
 2. US 22 %

## Classification
Base on: 
1. **timing**
	1. Elective
	2. Emergency
2. **Urgency**
	1. Emergent(cat 1): Immediate threat to life of mother/fetus (DDI <30min) i.e fetal distress(FSB PH<7.2), cord prolapse, uterine rupture.
	2. Urgent(cat 2): No immediate threat to life but there is compromise to mother or fetus (DDI 60 +/- 15min) i.e APH, FTP in labour with fetal distress.
	3. Schedule(cat 3): No fetal or maternal compromise but early delivery is required (DDI 1-2wks) i.e IUGR, worsening PE, Admitted cat. 4 with PROM.
	4. Elective(cat 4): Done at a time that suit the Obst, pt, and the theater. i.e 2previous c/s not in labour, fetal macrosomia, breech in primi. 
3.  **incision**
	1. LSCS
	2. classical
	3. J-shaped
	4. inverted T
4. **scar**
	1. Primary
	2. Repeat
	

## Indication
1. Maternal
	1. severe PE with unfavorable cervix
	2. previous classical cs
	3. 2previous LUS scar
	4. contracted pelvis
	5. Major placenta previa
	6. Abruptio placenta
	7. vasa previa
	8. Previous extensive uterine surgery i.e myomectomy
	9. Obstructive pelvic tumour
	10. previous 3rd degree perineal tear
	11. previous reconstructive vaginal surgery
	12. large vulva condylomata
	13. Abdominal cerclage
	14. Active genital herpes
	15. Ca cx
	
2. Fetal
	1. fetal distress in 1st stage of labour
	2. T2 malpresentation
	3. fetal macrosomiat
	4. very low birth weight 
	5. fetal abnormality
	6. cord prolapse with live fetus
	7. Transverse lie

## Surgical technique
1. skin incisions
	1. midline subumblical/infraumblical
	2. Pfannestiel
	3. Cohen
	4. Misgav Ladach
	5. Maylad
	6. Paramedian
2. Uterine incision
	1. classical
	2. u-shaped 
	3. inverted T
	4. J-shaped 
	5. Kerr(low transverse)
	6. De lee(low vertical)

## Instruments used for surgery
1. Scapel
2. Doyen's bladder retractor
3. forceps(artery, green armytage, sponge holding, Allis, Kocher's, dissecting{ tooth, non-tooth })

## Complications
Maternal
1. Anaesthesia i.e drug rxn, low RR, PR, & BP , asp. pneu.
2. Hemorrhage
3.  Injury to adjoining organ (bladder, bowel, ureters)
4. infection
5. Thromboembolism
6. Adhesion
7. incisional hernia
8. Endometriosis

Fetal complication
1. TTN
2.  injury to neonate(laceration, fractures)
3. Iatrogenic prematurity


## Conclusion

Proper classification helps improve **clinical decision-making**, ensures **optimal use of resources**, and enhances **maternal–fetal safety**.
